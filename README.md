Techinc, Amsterdam Hackspace.
Android Notification App.

The space broadcasts its current status in terms of open and closed.
When this status changes, the notification app will place a notification on the Android status bar.

The application can be found on [Google Play](https://github.com/techinc/Techinc-Notify/raw/master/bin/Techinc-Notify.apk)

To-do:

- Retry if failed instead of soft-fail
- Look into deprecating GCM
